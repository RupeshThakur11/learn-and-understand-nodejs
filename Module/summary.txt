1. require : is a function, that you pass a 'path' to.
2. module.exports : is what the require function returns.

This works because your code is actually wrapped in a function that is given these things as function parameters.
Whenever you're writing code in Node, you have
- require
- module ( exports is a property of module )
- __filename
- __dirname
to use,
cause what you write isn't the only thing that's given to V8.
What you write is actually the body of a function.
